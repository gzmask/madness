title: List of conditions and preferences, for recruiters
---

Since every once in a while - at an increasing frequency - recruiters
find me with all kinds of offers and opportunities. Most of these make
no sense, and with only a little bit of research, they wouldn't even
been sent. Now, I know that research is hard, especially when there
are so many places to look for information, so just below, I'll put
together a list of conditions, for recruiters. If **all** of them are
met, we can talk. If any of them is not, there is no point in mailing
me, you'll just get pointed to this page.

* I have been a Debian Developer since 2001, I intend to continue
  doing that, keep all my current roles, and perhaps even find other
  ways I can volunteer my free time to Debian. I'm not willing to
  sacrifice this
* I live in Hungary, and I am not willing to relocate. Periodic visits
  to HQ and remote work is, of course, acceptable. The reasons why I
  am unwilling to move are, in no particular order:
    * My girlfriend lives and works here.
    * My studies bind me to Hungary, I cannot get a degree in
      Hungarian Grammar and Literature anywhere else.
    * I like the country, and unless I have no other option,
      I'm not moving.
* I run Debian on my computers, all of them (except phone and tablet,
  which run Android until I can run Debian on them). I am not going to
  run anything else, except in a virtual machine or a chroot.
* With that said, the only packaging work I am willing to do is Debian
  packaging. No RPM .spec files, thank you very much.

I do not think these are all that strange conditions, but most
companies where recruiters found me from, failed on one or more of the
above (some even on all of them). However, these were only the
requirements. If you are truly interested in presenting me with an
opportunity that I should consider, you will find a list of
preferences below.

Please note that all my conditions **and** all my preferences are
satisfied by my current employer, with whom I am very happy with.

* I prefer working on Free Software, and I am doing exactly that at my
  current employer. I get paid to spend 100% of my time on free
  software.
* I don't like long commutes.
* I like reasonably flexible work hours, though.
* I like attending and speaking at conferences.
* My heart lies with functional programming languages, Clojure, in
  particular (but Haskell is great too).
* I like smart collegues and a great company spirit.
